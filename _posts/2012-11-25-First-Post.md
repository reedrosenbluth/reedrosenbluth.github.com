Hey there. Welcome to my new blog.

My name is Reed Rosenbluth and I am a 17 year old student from Long Island, New York interested in things like software development, the internet, education, and playing the guitar. I like to program iPhone apps and also love coding in Python. I just finished up an internship at Hunch/eBay in NYC this past summer, and am currently trying to get into college.

Hope you enjoy the blog.
